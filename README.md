YamSuph
=======

#### YamSuph is inexpensive, general purpose 3D printable liquid handling solution for parallelizing molecular protocols.

Mutlichannel pipetters and 3D printers are cheap, easy to use, and
easy to learn. Liquid handling robots are expensive, difficult to
program, and difficult to learn. YamSuph lets you use your 3D printer
to make single-use 96-well format titer plates that have different
volumes for each well. The volumes are configured using a text file
containing comma separated values. By controlling the volumes using
YamSuph, you never have to change the pietter settings during the
protocol.

YamSuph is intended for use with thousands or tens-of-thousands of
samples. Incorporating YamSuph into the workflow allows you to put
**all** of the per-sample actions into the workflow planning step,
rather than looking up liquid volumes and programming pipetters at the
bench.
